# support-vector-regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks, particularly when dealing with continuous target variables. It is an extension of Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are primarily designed for classification. SVR is particularly useful when the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is complex and nonlinear.

## Key Concepts:

### Linear Regression vs. Support Vector Regression:
While linear regression aims to find a linear relationship between input features and output, SVR focuses on finding a hyperplane that best represents the data with a specified margin, allowing for more flexibility in capturing nonlinear relationships.

### Kernel in SVR:
A kernel is a crucial component of SVR that allows it to handle nonlinear relationships effectively. Kernels are functions that transform the input features into a higher-dimensional space, making it possible to find a hyperplane in that space. Common kernels include Linear, Polynomial, and Radial Basis Function (RBF or Gaussian) kernels.

### Purpose of Kernel:
The purpose of using a kernel in SVR is to transform the input features into a space where a linear relationship can be effectively established. Kernels allow SVR to capture complex patterns and nonlinearities in the data, making the algorithm more versatile in various applications.

## Kernel Functions:
Different kernel functions serve different purposes.

### Linear Kernel: 
Suitable for linear relationships.
### Polynomial Kernel: 
Useful for capturing polynomial relationships of higher degree.
### RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel: 
Effective for capturing nonlinear patterns, especially when the relationship between variables is not easily defined by a polynomial.

### Support Vectors:
SVR identifies a subset of the data points called support vectors, which are crucial for determining the hyperplane. These support vectors are the data points that contribute most to the definition of the optimal hyperplane and the margin.
Feature Scaling in SVR:

Feature scaling is important in SVR due to the algorithm's sensitivity to the scale of input features, especially when using kernels like RBF. Features with different scales may lead to suboptimal performance, as one feature could dominate the others in the transformed space. Therefore, it is recommended to scale the features before applying SVR to ensure fair contributions from all features.
